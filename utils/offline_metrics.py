def kldiv(f, g):
    '''
    Calculate the Kullback-Leibler Divergence between two different PMFs. Assumes that both distributions share equal
    'bin' sizes, doesn't adjust for this.

    Some notes: KL divergence is _only_ defined when g(x) > 0 and f(x) > 0. Also, KL divergence is not a true
    distance metric, because its not symmetric (kldiv(f,g) is not guaranteed to be kldiv(g, f)). It also doesn't really
    care about number of samples, assuming everything is a true distribution. Here, computing with natural log, not base
    2.

    Inputs:
        f (ndarray):
            nx1 ndarray representing the pmf of a function across multiple bins (think these should be evenly spaced).
            In general, this should be your observed distribution (ground truth)
        g (ndarray):
            nx1 ndarray representing the pmf of a funciton across multiple bins (think these should be evenly spaced).
            Should match the size of f. In general, this should be your model (predicted distribution).

    Outputs:
        kldiv (float):
            Returns the KL-divergence between the two pmfs, taken as : Sig_x(f(x) * log(f(x)/g(x)) where x is an element
            of [0, n).
