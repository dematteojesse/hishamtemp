def adjustfeats(X, Y, lag=0, hist=0, fillb4=None, out2d=False):
    '''
    This function takes in neural data X and behavior Y and returns two "adjusted" neural data and behavior matrices
    based on the optional params. Specifically the amount of lag between neural data and behavior can be set in units
    and the number of historical bins of neural data can be set. (BASED ON CODE BY SAM NASON)
    Inputs:
        - X (ndarray):
            The neural data, which should be [t, neu] in size, where t is the numebr of smaples and neu is the number
            of neurons.
        - y (ndarray):
            The behavioral data, which should be [t, dim] in size, where t is the number of samples and dim is the
            number of states.
        - lag (int, optional):
            Defaults to 0. The number of bins to lag the neural data relative to the behavioral data. For example,
            adjustFeats(X,Y, lag=1) will return X[0:-1] for adjX and Y[1:] for adjY.
        - hist (int, optional):
            Default 0. The number of bins to append to each sample of neural data from the previous 'hist' bins.
        - fillb4 (ndarray or scalar, optional):
            Default None, disabled. This fills previous neural data with values before the experiment began. A single
            scalar wil fill all previous neural data with that value. Otherwise, a [1,neu] ndarray equal to the first
            dimension of X (# of neurons) should represent the value to fill for each channel.
        - out2d (bool, optional):
            if history is added, will return the adjusted matrices either in 2d or 3d form (2d has the history appended
            as extra columns, 3d has history as a third dimension. For example, out2d true returns a sample as:
            [1, neu*hist+1] whereas out2d false returns: [1, neu, hist+1]. Default False
    Outputs:
        - adjX (ndarray):
            The adjusted neural data
        - adjY (ndarray):
            The adjusted behavioral data
